## Description

* Data structure visualization tool: UI for graphic representation of data structures.

## Future features ideas:
1. Save & Load work from a binary file.
2. Generate memory address allocations.
3. Improve extracting data from given node when creating new node.
4. Animate flow of data & actions ( for ADT ): inset, find, delete, sort.
